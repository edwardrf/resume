* Typeself: Converted a old school typewriter to type out images [http://www.typeself.cc](http://www.typeself.cc)
This project has 2 main challenges, the algorithm to generate the character map which would be physically type out to be a picture, and using HTML and js to create the website to generate a fast enough animation using the exact font the typewriter has.
* Autonomous Sofa: An artist installation project which created an autonomous sofa returns to its original position and obstacle avoidance with only simple sensors.(杨振中-请坐) [Exhibition site: http://bit.do/asofa](http://bit.do/asofa) [http://bit.do/ysofa](http://bit.do/ysofa)
Creating an navigation algorithm with limited sensor input with considerable amount of noise is very challenging especially debugging involves hardware in the loop.
* Led and Lamp Matrix: Created small 8x8 led matrix as well as a 8x8 IKEA lamp matrix that does animation and can be controlled over the internet
